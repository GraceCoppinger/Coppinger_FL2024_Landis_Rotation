# Coppinger_FL2024_Landis_Rotation
The following repository consists of the topics I covered and tutorials I worked through at my time in the Landis lab. This repository is intended to be used as a resource for future students who are not sure where to start on their journey.
# Who am I and why you are using this repository
My name is Grace and I am a first year graduate student who rotated in the Landis lab from 8/26 -11/1. I came in with the intention to learn as much as I could about phylogenetic comparative methods, with an particular interest in disease evolution. Each week I focused on a broad topic under the umbrella that is Phylogenetic Comparative Methods. I made sure to read papers on that topic, complete tutorials, and when applicable generate a model. However, many of the resources on phylogenetic compartive methods are difficult to sort through, and some are not the most effective use of a students time. So I decided to make a repository about the good, bad, and ugly that came with me learning this material for the first time. I wanted to create a resource other students could use when startng their journey with good resources, and learn the material from another students perspective. The most helpful thing for me starting this journey was to write about everything I did, and intentionally plan my weeks. By staying organized and having intention I was able to create this repository and visually see all that I was able to acomplish. Additonally, pursue topics that are interesting for you. This motivated me every week to learn about things I was interested in, and what is most interesting to me might not be for others. Some really cool topics Phylogenetic Comparative Methods cover include: Biogeography, Niche Evolution, Macroecology, Coevolution, Disease Evolution, Ancestral State Reconstruction, and much more :) I will now get into how this repository is structured, and I hope you enjoy and are able to use this resource as needed. 


# Repository structure
This repository contains a folder for each week, where I will attach those papers, tutorials, and my breif summary of the topic I covered. I will do my best to include R scripts and websites as needed, but for clarity I will create two additonal folders labeled "Scripts" and "Other resources" for easy accses, where you can find that material as needed. The file named "Scripts" will include all of the R scripts I generated during my time here. Additonally, in the folder labeled "Other Resources" you can find my thoughts on how to use Chatgtp effectiently, and other resources I used in my time here. Finally, in the text file called "Thoughts and Revisions" you can find my thoughts on what went wrong, and what I would have done differently. If you are a rotating student in the landis lab, or just in general a human wanting to start learning Phylogenetic comparative methods: I highly reccomend reading "Thoughts and Revisions" before you start looking through my resources. I do not think over these ten weeks I covered all necessary material, or did everything perfectly. I only hope this repository will serve as a resource for other who do not know where to start. Enjoy and please contact me if any of the links are not working and need to be updated.

I hope you enjoy your rotation/ journey and best of luck!
