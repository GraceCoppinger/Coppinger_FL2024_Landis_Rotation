Alrgiht. For me learning how to make simulaitions and models for the first time... chatgtp was a necessary tool.

But, be warned... IT IS NOT ALWAYS CORRECT. I personally would only use it to make code if you are well versed in the language. 

Sometime that chagtp is great at is making short quizzes. 
A lot of the practice problems I put in here are practice problems chatgtp gave me when I was originally testing my knowledge.

So I think you should use chatgtp... but always understand the associated risks and check your work.
