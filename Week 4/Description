Week 4 Bayes Theorm and Maximum Likelihood:

Okay this week I tried to dig into some foundational concepts that phylogenetic comparative methods build off of. 
Before starting you should have a good understanind of joint, conditional, and marginal probabilites and have seen MLE and Bayes Theorm in Rev Bayes and BEAST tutorials.

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): Find a parameter that maximize the likelihood of observed data occuring. 
It is used to measure how well the model explains the data. MLE differes from Bayesian, becuase Bayesian methods require some known prior data.
I reccomend refering to the wikipedia page if you have further questions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation
Task to practice: Build a function that calculates the maximum likelihood of the follow x and y points. 
Your goal is to make a line and find the estimated best fit:
x <-c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <-c(2, 3, 5, 7)
Answer is in Week 9 ~ LinearRegression.R


Bayes theorm: Okay now lets really dig into it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem
Bayes Theorm combines all of our understanding of joint, conditional, and marginal probabilites. 
See the attached "Bayes.png" for a breakdown of the formula amd all its moving parts. 
Essentially the posterior probability will change given our prior probability. 
There are four key terms:
- Posterior probaility: Your updated belief about the hypothesis after taking into account the evidence. You report this
- Prior Probability: Your initial belief about the hypothesis before seeing the evidence.
- Likelihood: How likely the evidence is if the hypothesis is true.
- Marginal Likelihood: The total probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

For example lets say we want to calculate our chances of having a disease given a positive test. 
Here is the informtion I will provide: A disease affects 1% of the population. 
A medical test is available that correctly identifies the disease 90% of the time when a person has the disease (true positive rate). 
However, the test also has a 5% false positive rate, meaning it incorrectly indicates that a healthy person has the disease 5% of the time.
If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?

Using Bayes theorm determine what your Posterior probaility, Prior Probability, Likelihood, and Marginal Likelihood are. 
Use "Bayes.png" to determine and see "BayestestAnswer.png" to check your work
