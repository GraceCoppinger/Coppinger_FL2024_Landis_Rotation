Week 2:
For my second week I focused my attention on understanding BEAST, and starting BiSSE and SIR models. 

BEAST is a program that performs Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC. 
I was confused on those terms the first time I heard them, again go through the Luke Harmon textbook if you have not :). 
For now Bayesian analysis: We want to estimate an unknown parameter using probabilty from a prior. 
An example is to calculate the likelihood that a patient with a positive test result has a disease, you need to know the accuracy of the test and the prevalence of the disease in the population.
MCMC is also known as Markov chain Monte Carlo. MCMC is an algorithm used to draw samples from a probability distribution.
BEAST can be used for reconstructing phylogenie or testing evolutionary hypotheses. 
I worked through the first and second tutorial. And was able to develop Trace Plots.
Some new terms I learned this week: Burn in, MJ network analysis, Maximum likelihood, Bayes theorm

For the BiSSE model I started with making a birth death model using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMzCdwaXvdI
In this tutorial you should learn commands like set.seed and work on writing for loops that reflect population dynamics.
Next I started working with Raymond and Sean in the Landis lab to make a BiSSE model. 
A BiSSE model is a Binary-State Speciation and Extinction model. 
Essentially you have two states where speciation, extinction, and state condition can vary between the two.
For clarification, when you start on models always start with simulating the data yourself instead of incourporating trees and data sets right away. 
Luke Harmon has some awesome resources but he does not start with simulating and this caused me to really struggle and go off track for two weeks. 
I reccomend working through the revbayes tutorial: https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/sse/bisse.html for first time BiSSE builders. 
Additonally, I would utilize chatgtp to make the barebones of your script. Be cautous using chatgtp and make sure you understand the content and take good notes. 
Focus on understanding the steps of building the model, not memorizing the code.
If you want to see my personal notes check out "What is a BiSSE model" and "Making a BiSSE model in R"
When making your BiSSE model you should learn to: Write functions, for loops, and calculate likelihoods

For the SIR model I started with reading papers to understand all the different interworking and directions SIR models can go. 
I also hghly recomend working through SIR curves, and understanding how susceptability, infection, and recovery work together in populations. 
This website is pretty solid at describing the workings of an SIR model: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/sir-model
Additonally wikipedia is good at explaining complex models and formulas. 
Again I focused on understanding the general pattern an SIR model follows and used chatgtp to help me make it and spit out some curves.
