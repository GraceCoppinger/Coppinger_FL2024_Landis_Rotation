Week 1 Get organized and read Luke Harmons "Phylogenetic Comparative Methods": 

For my very first week I decided to get all my ducks in a row. 
I focused on content organization and developed a system for how I would read and organize my papers. 
First I highly reccomend reading the textbook Phylogenetic Comparative Methods by Luke Harmon. 
He does a fantastic job explaning core concepts and describing specific models that are commonly used. 
I reccomend picking the models you are most interested in and focusing on core concepts that go into those. 
For example I chose BiSSE models and SIR models. 
I chose these models becuase BiSSE is a cornerstone in describing traits and how they change in different states. 
I chose SIR becuase it is commonly used in disease inference models. 
I will review both of those models in week 2, and I decided to work consistently on builiding those models throughout my time here. 

Following this I decided to plan how I would read and organize all of my papers. I chose to use Zotero. https://www.zotero.org/
I made a point of always recoriding the author, year, and journal. 
I wrote a summary focusing of why, how and what.
AKA: Why was this study important. How did the authors complete this study. What were the key findings.
Make sure to also highlight any new concepts that you want to explore further.
