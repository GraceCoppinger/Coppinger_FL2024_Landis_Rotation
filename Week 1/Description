Week 1 Get organized and read Luke Harmons "Phylogenetic Comparative Methods": 

For my very first week I decided to get all my ducks in a row. I ficused on content organization and developed a system for how I would read and organize my papers. 
First I highly reccomend reading the textbook Phylogenetic Comparative Methods by Luke Harmon. He does a fantastic job explaning core concepts and describing specific models that are commonly used. 
I reccomend picking the models you are most interested in and focusing on core concepts that go into those. For example I chose BiSSE models and SIR models. 
I will review both of those models in week 2, and I decided to work consistently on builiding those models throughout my time here.
