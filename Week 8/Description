Week 8: Ordinary least squares and Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares

This week started off as most do... reading and noticing a common concept through many papers. 
OLS and PGLS are frequently talked about and refered to, so this week I decided to make sure I actually comprehend these topics.

What is OLS:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares
OLS estimates the parameters of a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values).
It is best applied to independent data without any hierarchical structure.


What is PGLS:

PGLS is designed for analyzing data that includes phylogenetic relationships among species. 
It accounts for the non-independence of observations that arise from evolutionary relatedness.
It incorporates a phylogenetic covariance structure, and assumes that the error terms may be correlated due to shared evolutionary history.

The key difference is OLS assumes NO COVARIANCE between residuals, where PGLS assumes there is evoultionary relatedness via common ancestor.
See "OLSvsPGLS.png" for a graphic comparing covariance matrixs of the two.
