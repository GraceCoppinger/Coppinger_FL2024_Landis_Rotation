During my rotation I was able to get a solid understanding of the core concepts and mechanisms that went into building models and interperating phylogenetic data. 
While I am happy with the out come of my rotation, I know there is quite a bit of material I did not cover. 
I strongly advise using this resource to locate good websites and papers about these topics, BUT please do not follow this as your rotation week by week schedule.
I always felt like I learned the most when things did not go smoothly, and you should give yourself space to make mistakes and research topics interesting to you. 
Nonetheless making this repository showed me how much I learned along the way, and I highly reccomend you doing the same. 

What I wish I had done differently:
- Spent less time on inference models. 
- Spent way more time on simulation models
- Explored building other types of models: 
    -Specifically, Brownian motion and OU models, HKY subsitution models, and more elaborote SIR models

Overall, I am very happy with how much I learned during my rotation and I hope it can be useful to others in the future.
