Week 4 Bayes Theorm and Maximum Likelihood:

Okay this week I tried to dig into some foundational concepts that phylogenetic comparative methods build off of. 

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): Find a parameter that maximize the likelihood of observed data occuring. 
It is used to measure how well the model explains the data. MLE differes from Bayesian, becuase Bayesian methods require some known prior data.
