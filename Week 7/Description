Week 7 Pagels Lambda:
Pagel's lambda (λ) is a tool used in ecology and evolution to measure the strength of the phylogenetic signal in a set of traits.
Essentially it measures: How closely do related species resemble one another in their traits, relative to what's expected under a Brownian motion model.
Values close to 0 indicate no phylogenetic signal, while values close to 1 indicate trait evolution according to Brownian motion.
Pagels lambda can be used to describe trait evolution, impute missing species data, and generalize ecological relationships. 

I highly reccomend reading "How to define, use, and interpret Pagel’s λ (lambda) in ecology and evolution" by William D. Pearse 
As well as "Inferring the historical patterns of biological evolution" by Mark Pagel. 
Luke Harmon also has a tutorial if you choose to walk through it. https://lukejharmon.github.io/ilhabela/instruction/2015/06/02/ContinuousModels/#:~:text=Another%20method%20for%20testing%20phylogenetic,to%20have%20no%20phylogenetic%20signal.

Now for practice simulate a 4 tip tree in R using Ape. and calculate Pagels Lambda by hand. 
Use set.seed(132)
You will need to:
-obtain branch legths including internal nodes
-Write a Q-matrix with the branch lengths
-Apply pagels lambda to the off diagonals
-Use phylosig to calculate pagels lambda

See "Pagels.R" and PagesAnswer.png to check your work
