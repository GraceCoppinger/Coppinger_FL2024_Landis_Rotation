Week 7 Pagels Lambda:


Now for practice simulate a 4 tip tree in R using Ape. and calculate Pagels Lambda by hand. 
Use set.seed(132)
You will need to:
-obtain branch legths including internal nodes
-Write a Q-matrix with the branch lengths
-Apply pagels lambda to the off diagonals
-Use phylosig to calculate pagels lambda

See "Pagels.R" and PagesAnswer.png to check your work
