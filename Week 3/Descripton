Week 3 Marginal, Conditional, and Joint Probability

Alright some things you need to know when figuring out the proability of an event happening, a tree being accurate, or a trait being displayed. 
I highly reccomend working through the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu-HhF3SpbE

Marginal: Prob of 1 event occurring independent of any other event
   For example- P(A) 
      A- Prob of selling a piece of clothing regardless the location

Conditional- Prob of an event occurring dependent of another event
   For example- P(A|B) Prob of selling a piece of clothing if we know the person is from NY?
      A- Prob of selling a piece of clothing regardless the location

Joint- Prob of 2 events happening simultaneously
   For example- P(A,B) 
      A- Prob of selling a piece of clothing
      B- Prob of selling at a location

For the examples imagine this data set:
	NY	Cali	Tot
Tshirt	.13	.22	.35
Pants	.17	.09	.26
Shoes	22	.17	.39
Tot	.52	.48	1

These three terms will come up constantly and working to adequitly understand them is important.
